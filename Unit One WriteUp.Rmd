##Results

Download the data and, where applicable, the code used in the analysis and attempt to reproduce one or more parts of the analysis...At the end, complete a short writeup that provides a narrative description of your groupâ€™s objectives, progress, stumbling blocks, and any results. A page should be sufficient. Each group need only submit a single writeup each week. Plan to spend 3-4 hours on the reproducibility assignment, including the writeup. It is understood that this investment of time may not result in completion of the analysis; the point is rather to have you grapple with the method to improve your understanding.
